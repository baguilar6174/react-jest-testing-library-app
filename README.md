# Testing React with Jest and React Testing Library

React Testing Library has become an extremely popular option for testing React, and with good reason! This detailed, comprehensive course provides a solid foundation for React app tests.

## What I learned

- Testing simple and complex React applications with React Testing Library
- Making the most of Jest watch mode, including running only one file or test at a time
- React Testing best Practices: how to test behavior instead of implementation
- Common errors returned by Testing Library and how to correct them

### Built with

- React JS 18
- Vite
- Semantic UI
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Eslint & Prettier
